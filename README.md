# Overview

I've developed a Number Guessing Game as part of my journey as a software engineer to enhance my learning. This software allows a player to guess a randomly selected number within a specified range (1 to 100) until the correct number is guessed or the player runs out of attempts.

My goal in creating this software was to reinforce my understanding of fundamental programming concepts like variables, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, and file operations. Additionally, I aimed to implement inheritance and explore user interaction in a console-based environment.
